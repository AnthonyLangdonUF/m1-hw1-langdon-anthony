# My First Coding Assignment #

## About me ##
Hello! I'm Anthony. I'm in my second semester at UF for my Masters in Global Strategic Communication. I live near Orlando with my fiancé, our 11-month old son and our dog, Gus. I love to write and watch football, and in the new year would love to get back into drumming, visit more national parks and, most importantly, marry my fiancé in November!

## Past Coding Experience ##
None at all! I would imagine I am not the only one finding this course daunting, but I am open to the challenge. I hope I can bring what I learn from this course to my web optimization internship with Electronic Arts in the summer. 

## Career Goals ##
I started this degree in the hopes of expanding on my skills in writing and communication, while also learning some new ones (like coding!). Ultimately, the goal is to sharpen these skills enough to qualify myself for a role in the entertainment or sports business where I can help optimize intercultural communication and bridge gaps across borders and cultures.
